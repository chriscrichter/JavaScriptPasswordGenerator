JavaScript Homework: Password Generator

## Description

This is an application built in HTML and CSS powered by  JavaScript code that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

  * Length (between 8 and 128 characters)
  * Character type:
  * Special characters
  * Numeric characters
  * Lowercase characters
  * Uppercase characters

The application will validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. The user will then have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
